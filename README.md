# PokerClass

## Steps to Run:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine (git clone https://github.com/ajag408/PokerClass.git)
2. Open Poker-Class-Prediction-Master.ipynb in an appropriate software tool (we tested with Jupyter Notebook)
3. Starting from the "Preprocessing" Header, run each code block consecutively to reproduce our results (use !pip install ____ for any missing library (replace ____ with the library name))
  a) Sample test set of 7% of the test data (70,000 sample poker hands) available at bottom of file.  Simply run the code block there to read in the sample data and evaluate on our chosen model.  
      i. 7% chosen because large enough to include samples representing every class label (0-9)
